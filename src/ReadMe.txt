Funtionality:
 
In assignment 3, 2 features were mentioned i.e (bookings and payment) and the feature developed on assignment 4 is bookings. The available rooms page was worked 
upon by William in our team, but the link from available rooms to book rooms page is the functionality established by me. The user has to click on book now on the 
available room page.

Note: The link from Available room to book rooms is established by Available rooms page >>book now. As of now the link from the 'book now' on 'view details'
(developed by William)the page is not established so the user can navigate only from the main page(Available rooms)

Once it is clicked, the book rooms page will display the details based on the beds selected. For example, on the 'available rooms page' if the user clicks on the 
Room type: 4 beds or 1 bed, the details regarding that room will be displayed. The total cost will be added up and be shown on the book rooms page. Once the user 
clicks on pay on check-in, the details will get updated on the database  


Frameworks:

Boostrap: this is a powerful and popular CSS framwork with and all my groupmates had experience with this framework
Angular 7: This is a power MVC Javascript Framework and most of my team members had good experience with this framework


Database:

Firebase will be used to write the backend for our website as it always provides quicker access to the data and this helps us to 
search for the data easier and faster.
