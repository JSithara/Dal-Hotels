This is the README file that is in association with the assignment four submission for William Devine. Within this file, you will find all associated information, such as where the application is hosted, how to access it, git lab, what has been done, and more.


The Application:
    Frontend:
    The application takes advantage of googles latest version on Angular, which is Angular 7. Angular is TypeScript based framework that allows for asynchronous manipulation of the front end, as well as providing data via databases and APIs.
    The other framework we used was Bootstrap 4 as a CSS framework.

    Backend:
    For the backend of our application, our team opted to use Firebase Firestore Cloud database. Firebase is a NoSQL database created by Google and is very straightforward in terms of connecting with Angular. Our team decided to use this type of database for a couple of reasons. First, Google creates both Angular 7 and Firebase; it makes integrating much easier. Second Firebase has more capabilities than just storing data; it can authenticate a user and host application, to name a few. Finally, our team wanted the opportunity to learn a new form of data storage.


Application URL:
    The application is hosted via Dalhousie computer science bluenose server that is provided to all students. Since this is an Angular 7 application, the current URL of 'http://web.cs.dal.ca/~username/' is not able to be used, but instead, the IP address of bluenose must be used. 

    The following is the URL of where the application is being hosted:
        http://129.173.22.35:26543


Git Lab:
    Our project repository is hosted on GitLab. My specific branch for this assignment is 'william_a4'. All professors and TA's have been added as a maintainer to the repository. The link to the repository is as follows:
		https://git.cs.dal.ca/agbola/web_project_group_7


My tasks:
    As was defined in the assignment description, each member had to do one task with integrating the backend. My responsibilities were to have all available rooms showing up on the available rooms page. Also, I had to have it so when the user clicks view details for a specific room; the view details page will retrieve the correct details for the corresponding room. Finally, so that the other group members would have an easier time with their work; I set up Firebase database, populated it with a large amount of data, and connected the application to the Firebase.

    The pages I worked on (exepct the firebase conection page) will have my name at the top. I primarily worked withing the /available-room/:allfiles , /hotel-details/:allfiles , and available-room-service.service.ts files
