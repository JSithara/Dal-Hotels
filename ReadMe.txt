Feature: Search Feature 

Overview 
This feature involves the design of an interactive search bar for users of the application. 
The backend received the queries sent to the frontend by the user and uses those queries to generate
the set of the room which fit those criteria. the search bars filters are generated from the NoSql database and this helps the user to make 
accurate results

Modifications 
The Feature was initially a single dropdown with the search query being performed on one criterion however while developing the search I discovered that a multi-varied search bar would be more suitable for the user and so I developed the search bar with 5 different filters to provide the user with an interactive way to search for rooms.
