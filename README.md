**Project Summary**

The Dal hotel booking system is a web application to help manage the hotel booking history. Users who use the application are customers and staff. The application should be able to send metadata to the Datacenter whenever users’ book or edit the bookings. The report is offering an explorative study of the technologies that are essential to enhance the hotel booking system. The report covers essentials components like user interface, data storage, data transfer. In each case, technical background, implementation discussion, and alternatives are depicted. Our objective is to provide web users with a fast hotel booking website. We will store the booking data while transferring it to the data center.  The website should be easy to be understood by everyday users.

Different from other similar products in the market, our website is more focused on user experience and searching speed. To improve user experience, we focus on heuristic evaluation to measure our product. Jakob Nielsen’s heuristics are the most popular usability heuristics. There are ten heuristics in Nielsen’s theory. Also, Firestore is chosen to speed up our web service. The Real-Time Database provided by Firebase will return the entire subtree in all queries while the Firestore only returns documents in a particular collection or collection group. Firestore does not return sub collection data when the queries are shallow. Since we do not need deep queries in a hotel booking website, the Firestore can improve our searching user experience [3]. 

**Features**

• Customers can search for the hotel according to their preference and can easily book the
rooms without any hassle

• The customer can provide feedback about their experience in the hotel.

• The customer would be getting reward points or discounts and will be able to redeem
their points as their points build up.

• The customer can cancel their booking and claim for refund.

• The customer can view their booking history

• The customer has the option to pay through the website or over the hotel counter.

• A site manager can add or remove new rooms.

• User can register, login, and update their profiles.

## Frameworks and technologies 

* Boostrap: This is a powerful and popular CSS framwork with and all my groupmates had experience with this framework

* Angular 7: This is a power MVC Javascript Framework and most of my team members had good experience with this framework

* Firebase: This a google cloud product that give application functionalities like NoSql databases, analytics and other features
